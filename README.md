# Stable-Marriage-Problem
First project for my Programming Paradigms course. It's a description for the "Stable-Marriage-Problem"(using the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find out who is the best match for any man and woman in the preferences lists) and at the same time an introduction to "Racket" and functional programming.
