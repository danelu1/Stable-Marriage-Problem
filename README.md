# Stable-Marriage-Problem
First project for my Programming Paradigms course. It's a description for the "Stable-Marriage-Problem"(using the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find out who is the best match for any man and woman in the preferences lists) and at the same time an introduction to "Racket" and functional programming.
The last stage of the project also contains a few more algorithms similar to "Gale-Shapley", but this time we are seeing how the list of engagements evolves over time, deppending of the new preferences each person has.
It was a nice and fun project which helped me learn the basics of functional programming, like anonymous functions, higher order functions, bindings and streams in "Racket".
